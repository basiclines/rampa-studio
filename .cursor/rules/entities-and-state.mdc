### 1. Entity Responsibilities
- Define **data models only** - no logic
- Export interfaces and types
- Keep related types together (e.g., `BlendMode` with `BLEND_MODES`)

### 2. State Management Rules with zustand
- One main store for core data: `ColorRampsStore`
- Separate stores for different concerns: `SelectColorRamp`, `PreviewBlendModes`
- Use `updateColorRamps` helper for array mutations
- Keep stores focused and single-purpose
