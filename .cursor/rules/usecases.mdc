# Usecase Development Guide

## Architecture
Usecases follow a clean architecture pattern that separates pure business logic from state management. Each usecase consists of:
- **Pure Function**: Zero-dependency business logic that's easily testable
- **React Hook**: Zustand integration for UI components

## Goals
- **Testability**: Pure functions work with any test runner (Bun, Jest, Vitest)
- **Reusability**: Business logic can be used in different contexts
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation between business logic and framework code
- **Predictability**: Same input always produces same output
