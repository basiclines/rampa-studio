# GIT Actions

## DO
1. Check via git diff current working dir and overall changes
2. Make separated commits as needed to have an ordered log of changes
3. All commits start with: FIX:, ADD:, REMOVE: or UPDATE:
4. You can only use git, cd, ls commands
5. If new images are added, make sure to call [optimize-images.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/optimize-images.mdc) before committing

## DONT'S
* NEVER push unless is asked to do so
* NEVER restore/stash changes without additional confirmation from the user
* NEVER make changes on the code before commiting
