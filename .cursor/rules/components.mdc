### 1. Component Responsibilities
- Components should be **presentational only**
- Business logic belongs in **usecases**, not components
- Use usecases hooks to interact with state
- Keep local state minimal (only trivial UI state like hover, focus)

### 2. Component Props
- Prefer passing IDs over full objects when possible
- Avoid prop drilling - use usecases for shared state
- Don't pass `setColorRamps` or similar setters as props

### 3. Color Logic Location
- **All color manipulation** goes in `@/lib/colorUtils`
- Never implement color logic in components or usecases
- Keep color functions **pure** (no side effects)
