# Proofreading guidelines

*	Review spellchecking, puntuaction and grammar issues.
*	Tone should be friendly and approachable: Write in a conversational, warm, and human tone. Avoid formal or impersonal language like “users,” “individuals,” or “consumers.”
*	Clear and simple: Use clear, easy-to-understand language, free from unnecessary jargon or complexity.
*	Use plain English: Avoid complex nouns and verbs. Choose words so simple that even someone who is not a native English speaker can understand the message easily.
* Avoid capitalization of titles, just use uppercase for the opening word in a sentence.
