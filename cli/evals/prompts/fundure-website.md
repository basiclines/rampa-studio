Create a simple, elegant static website for Fundure Ventures using a single HTML file with Tailwind CSS utility classes (via CDN).

## Requirements

1. **Discover rampa first**: Run `rampa --help` to understand all available commands and flags before generating any colors.

2. **Every color must come from rampa output**: Do not invent or hardcode hex codes. Use rampa to generate the color palette for the site. Pick a sophisticated, minimal base color (dark navy, charcoal, or deep indigo) and use rampa's harmony flags to derive all accent and supporting colors.

3. **Use mathematical color combinations**: Use rampa's built-in harmony flags (`--add=complementary`, `--add=triadic`, `--add=square`, `--add=shift:N`, etc.) to generate mathematically related color palettes. Avoid running many separate rampa commands to get ad-hoc colors.

4. **Efficient command usage**: Prefer fewer rampa commands with `--add` flags to generate multiple related ramps at once.

5. **Token → Semantic color architecture**: Structure colors in two layers:
   - **Tokens**: Raw color values from rampa output (e.g. `primary-100`, `primary-200`, ..., `accent-100`, `neutral-50`, etc.)
   - **Semantics**: Design-intent names that reference tokens (e.g. `bg-surface: primary-950`, `text-body: neutral-200`, `bg-surface-hover: primary-900`, `accent: accent-400`, etc.)
   - Define both layers in the Tailwind config. The HTML should only use semantic names, never raw tokens directly.

## Technical Requirements

- Single `index.html` file
- Tailwind CSS via CDN (`<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>`)
- Use Tailwind's `<script>` config block to define:
  1. **Token colors** from rampa output (raw palette values)
  2. **Semantic colors** that map to tokens (design-intent layer)
- **Dark/light mode**: Include both themes with a toggle button. Use Tailwind's `dark:` variant. Semantic color mappings should change between modes (e.g. `bg-surface` is light in light mode, dark in dark mode). Use a small inline `<script>` for the toggle that adds/removes the `dark` class on `<html>`.
- Responsive design (mobile-first)
- Clean, modern, minimal aesthetic — generous whitespace, large typography
- **Icons**: Use an existing icon set via CDN (Lucide, Heroicons, Phosphor, or similar). Do NOT create inline SVGs manually — link the icon library and use their component/class system.
- **Fonts**: Use Google Fonts for typography. Pick a modern pair (e.g. Inter, Satoshi, Plus Jakarta Sans, or similar).
- **Images**: If the design benefits from imagery, use Unsplash via direct URL (`https://images.unsplash.com/...`). Keep it minimal — one hero image at most.
- No external JavaScript beyond Tailwind CDN and the dark mode toggle
- Use semantic HTML

## Deliverable

Output the complete `index.html` file with:
- All rampa-sourced token colors in the Tailwind config
- Semantic color layer mapping tokens to design intent
- Dark/light mode toggle working
- Show the rampa commands you used and explain which output colors you picked for each design token
